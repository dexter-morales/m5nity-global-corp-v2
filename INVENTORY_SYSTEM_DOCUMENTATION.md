### Fast & Slow Moving Products

The system tracks product movement over a configurable period (default 30 days):

- **Slow Moving**: Products with low or no outgoing transactions

This helps with:

- Inventory optimization
- Purchasing decisions
- Promotional planning

### Expiration Tracking

Products can have expiration dates with automatic alerts:

- **Expired**: Products past their expiration date
- **Expiring Soon**: Products expiring within 30 days

Alerts appear:

- In product listings (badges)
- On product detail pages
- In inventory reports
- In the reports dashboard

### Stock Adjustment System

Stock can be adjusted through:

1. **Stock In**: Adding inventory
2. **Stock Out**: Removing inventory
3. **Adjustment**: Setting exact quantity

All adjustments are:

- Tracked in `inventory_transactions` table
- Audited with user information
- Displayed in product history

### Low Stock Warnings

The system compares `stock_quantity` with `reorder_level`:

- Visual warnings in listings
- Dedicated low stock report
- Dashboard statistics
- Export capabilities for reorder planning

## üîê Security
