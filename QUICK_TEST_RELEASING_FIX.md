# Quick Test - Releasing Permission Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The **409 Conflict error** when releasing personnel tried to release orders is now fixed!

## 🔧 The Problem

- Releasing personnel got "Unauthorized" error when trying to release orders
- Only cashiers who created the order could release it
- This blocked the releasing workflow

## ✅ The Solution

**Authorization Logic Updated:**

- ✅ **Cashiers** can only release their own orders (security)
- ✅ **Releasing Personnel** can release ANY order (their job role)
- ✅ **Superadmins** can release any order

## 🧪 Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### Test 1: Releasing Personnel Can Release Orders

1. **Login as Releasing Personnel** (utype: `releasing_personnel`)
2. Navigate to **Releasing → Orders**
3. Find an order in "For Release" tab
4. Click "Release Order"
5. Enter recipient name
6. Click "Confirm Release"

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Order releases successfully
- ✅ No 409 Conflict error
- ✅ No "Unauthorized" message
- ✅ Order moves to "Completed" tab

### Test 2: Cashiers Still Work

1. **Login as Cashier**
2. Go to **Cashier POS**
3. Mark an order as paid
4. Go to "For Release" tab
5. Click "Release Order" on YOUR order

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Works normally (no change)

### Test 3: Cashier Cannot Release Other's Orders (Security)

1. **Login as Cashier A**
2. Try to release an order created by Cashier B

**Expected Result:**

- ❌ Error: "Unauthorized - You can only release your own orders"
- ✅ This is correct behavior for security
