# 📦 Inventory System Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Inventory System has been successfully integrated with the Cashier Registration module. This update allows cashiers to select packages during member registration, and releasing personnel can now release these packages.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Changes**

- ✅ Created `inventory_products` table (separate from existing `products` table)
- ✅ Created `packages` table
- ✅ Created `package_product` pivot table (links packages to products)
- ✅ Created `inventory_transactions` table (tracks stock movements)

**Why separate tables?**

- The existing `products` table is simple and used for POS
- The `inventory_products` table has advanced features (stock management, expiration dates, etc.)

### 2. **Cashier Registration Integration**

#### Backend Changes (`app/Http/Controllers/Cashier/CashierRegistrationController.php`)

- ✅ Added `Package` model import
- ✅ Load active packages with products in `index()` method
- ✅ Added `package_id` validation in `store()` method
- ✅ Store selected package information with registration

#### Frontend Changes (`resources/js/pages/Cashier/Registration.tsx`)

- ✅ Added package types and interfaces
- ✅ Added package selection dropdown
- ✅ Display selected package contents (products and quantities)
- ✅ Show package price alongside name

**New Fields in Registration Form:**

```typescript
{
    package_id: string; // Required - selected package ID
}
```

### 3. **Releasing Personnel**

#### Seeder Created (`database/seeders/ReleasingPersonnelSeeder.php`)

- ✅ Creates releasing personnel user account
- ✅ Email: `releasing@example.com`
- ✅ Password: `password`
- ✅ Includes duplicate check (safe to run multiple times)

#### Role Permissions

- ✅ Can add/edit products
- ✅ Can adjust stock quantities
- ✅ Can view and generate reports
- ✅ Can release packages purchased at cashier

### 4. **Sample Data**

#### Default Packages

1. **Standard Package** - ₱4,000.00
    - 2× Premium Wellness Supplement
    - 3× Energy Booster Pack
    - 2× Immune Support Tablets

2. **Premium Package** - ₱7,500.00
    - 3× Premium Wellness Supplement
    - 5× Energy Booster Pack
    - 3× Immune Support Tablets
    - 2× Protein Shake Mix

#### Sample Products (5 items)

- Premium Wellness Supplement (₱500, Stock: 100)
- Energy Booster Pack (₱350, Stock: 150)
- Immune Support Tablets (₱450, Stock: 75)
- Detox Tea Blend (₱250, Stock: 200)
- Protein Shake Mix (₱800, Stock: 50)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Cashier Flow

1. Cashier logs in and goes to **Cashier Registration**
2. Fills in member details (name, email, mobile, etc.)
3. Selects **Payment Method**
4. **Selects Registration Package** (e.g., Standard or Premium)
    - Package contents are displayed below the dropdown
5. Submits the form
6. System records the registration with package information

### Releasing Personnel Flow

1. Releasing Personnel logs in with credentials:
    - Email: `releasing@example.com`
    - Password: `password`
2. Views registered members awaiting package release
3. Verifies payment and registration details
4. Releases the selected package to the member
5. System tracks stock deduction via inventory transactions

## 🎨 UI Components

### Package Selector

- Dropdown showing all active packages
- Displays: Package Name - Price (Product Count)
- Example: "Standard Package - ₱4,000.00 (3 products)"

### Package Contents Display

- Shows when a package is selected
- Lists all products with quantities
- Example:
    ```
    Package Contents:
    - 2x Premium Wellness Supplement (PROD-001)
    - 3x Energy Booster Pack (PROD-002)
    - 2x Immune Support Tablets (PROD-003)
    ```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Table Name Change

- Inventory products use `inventory_products` table
- POS products use `products` table
- This prevents conflicts and maintains existing functionality

### Model Configuration

```php
// app/Models/Product.php
protected $table = 'inventory_products';
```

### Migration Dependencies

1. `inventory_products` (first)
2. `packages` (second)
3. `package_product` (third - requires both above)
4. `inventory_transactions` (fourth - requires inventory_products)
