# Release Order Modal Consistency Fix

## 🎯 Issue

The Release Order confirmation dialogs were inconsistent between Cashier POS and Releasing pages:

**Before:**

1. **Cashier POS**: Simple dialog with "Release order X?" message and "Received By" input
2. **Releasing Page**: Formal AlertDialog with descriptive message but NO "Received By" input (hardcoded to 'Member')

## ✅ Solution

Made both pages use the same consistent, professional AlertDialog design with all required functionality.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Releasing Orders Page (`resources/js/pages/Releasing/Orders.tsx`)

**Added:**

- `Input` and `Label` component imports
- `notifyError` for better error handling
- `receivedBy` state variable
- Input validation before submission

**Updated:**

- Added "Received By (Name)" input field to the AlertDialog
- Changed from hardcoded `'Member'` to actual user input
- Improved error handling with toast notifications instead of alert()
- Fixed TypeScript PageProps interface

**Dialog Now Shows:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Confirm Order Release                   │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Are you sure you want to mark order    │
│ T-25PH00000012-xxxxx as released?      │
│ This action indicates that the products│
│ have been delivered to the member.     │
│                                        │
│ Received By (Name)                     │
│ ┌────────────────────────────────────┐│
│ │ Enter recipient name                ││
│ └────────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                        │
│           [Cancel]  [Confirm Release]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Updated Cashier POS Page (`resources/js/pages/Cashier/POS.tsx`)

**Added:**

- AlertDialog component imports

**Updated:**

- Changed from simple `Dialog` to formal `AlertDialog`
- Added descriptive confirmation message
- Kept the "Received By" input field
- Maintained existing validation logic

**Dialog Now Shows:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Confirm Order Release                   │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Are you sure you want to mark order    │
│ T-25PH00000012-xxxxx as released?      │
│ This action indicates that the products│
│ have been delivered to the member.     │
│                                        │
│ Received By (Name)                     │
│ ┌────────────────────────────────────┐│
│ │ Enter recipient name                ││
│ └────────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                        │
│           [Cancel]  [Confirm Release]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎨 Design Benefits

### Consistency

- ✅ Both pages use the same AlertDialog component
- ✅ Same title: "Confirm Order Release"
- ✅ Same descriptive message format
- ✅ Same button labels: "Cancel" and "Confirm Release"
- ✅ Same input field label: "Received By (Name)"

### User Experience

- ✅ Actual recipient name is recorded for audit trail
- ✅ Validates input before submission

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Releasing Orders Component Structure:

```typescript
// State management
const [receivedBy, setReceivedBy] = useState('');

// Validation before submission
if (!receivedBy.trim()) {
    notifyError('Please enter who received the order');
    return;
}

// AlertDialog with input field
<AlertDialog>
    <AlertDialogContent>
        <AlertDialogHeader>
            <AlertDialogTitle>Confirm Order Release</AlertDialogTitle>
            <AlertDialogDescription>...</AlertDialogDescription>
        </AlertDialogHeader>
        <div className="px-6 py-4">
            <Label>Received By (Name)</Label>
            <Input
                value={receivedBy}
                onChange={(e) => setReceivedBy(e.target.value)}
                autoFocus
            />
        </div>
        <AlertDialogFooter>
            <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
            <AlertDialogAction onClick={confirmRelease}>
                Confirm Release
            </AlertDialogAction>
        </AlertDialogFooter>
    </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

### Cashier POS Component Structure:

```typescript
// Same structure as Releasing Orders
// Uses AlertDialog instead of Dialog
// Maintains existing validation with notifyError
```
