# Releasing Personnel Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a **read-only workflow** for releasing personnel who handle physical product distribution to members. They can view orders and registrations but CANNOT create or modify them - only mark them as released when products are delivered.

## What Was Built

### 1. Navigation Updates ✅

**File**: `resources/js/components/app-sidebar.tsx`

Releasing personnel now see:

- Dashboard (Releasing-specific)
- **Orders** (read-only list with release capability)
- **Registrations** (read-only list with release capability)
- Inventory (Products, Packages)
- Inventory Reports

**Removed** access to:

- Cashier POS (order creation)
- Cashier Registrations (member registration)

### 2. Frontend Pages Created ✅

#### `resources/js/pages/Releasing/Dashboard.tsx`

- Summary statistics (pending releases, released today, out of stock)
- Quick action buttons to Orders and Registrations
- Low stock alerts
- Recent orders ready for release

#### `resources/js/pages/Releasing/Orders.tsx`

- **For Release Tab**: Orders paid and ready for product delivery
- **Completed Tab**: Orders already released (reference only)
- Table with order details (member, items, total)
- "Release" button for each order
- Calls cashier endpoint to mark as released

#### `resources/js/pages/Releasing/Registrations.tsx`

- **For Release Tab**: Registrations paid and ready for package delivery
- **Completed Tab**: Registrations already released (reference only)
- Table with registration details (member, package, payment)
- "Release" button for each registration
- Calls releasing endpoint to mark as released

### 3. Backend Routes Created ✅

**File**: `routes/releasing.php`

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:releasing_personnel'])
    ->prefix('releasing')
    ->name('releasing.')
    ->group(function () {
        // Dashboard
        GET /releasing → releasing.dashboard

        // Read-only Orders
        GET /releasing/orders → releasing.orders.index

        // Read-only Registrations
        GET /releasing/registrations → releasing.registrations.index
        POST /releasing/registrations/{id}/release → releasing.registrations.release
    });
```

### 4. Controllers Created ✅

#### `app/Http/Controllers/Releasing/ReleasingDashboardController.php`

- Fetches summary statistics
- Gets orders ready for release
- Gets low stock warnings

#### `app/Http/Controllers/Releasing/ReleasingOrdersController.php`

- Fetches orders with status `for_release`
- Fetches completed orders for reference
- Includes order items and member details

#### `app/Http/Controllers/Releasing/ReleasingRegistrationsController.php`

- Fetches registrations with status `for_release`
- Fetches completed registrations for reference
- Handles marking registrations as released
- Logs activity via `ActivityLogService`

### 5. Permissions Updated ✅

**Cashier Routes** (`routes/cashier.php`):

- Changed from `role:cashier,releasing_personnel` to `role:cashier` ONLY
- Releasing personnel can NO LONGER access `/cashier/*` routes
- They cannot create orders or registrations

**Releasing Routes** (`routes/releasing.php`):

- Restricted to `role:releasing_personnel` only
- Provides read-only access with release capability

### 6. Activity Logging Updated ✅

**File**: `app/Services/ActivityLogService.php`

Updated `logRelease()` method to support both order and registration releases:

```php
public function logRelease(
    int $userId,
    string $type,        // 'order' or 'registration'
    int $recordId,
    string $transNo,
    string $receivedBy = null
): ActivityLog
```

Used in:

- `OrdersController::markAsReleased` - Order releases
- `ReleasingRegistrationsController::markAsReleased` - Registration releases

## Workflow Diagram

```
CASHIER WORKFLOW:
1. Cashier creates order/registration → Status: pending
2. Cashier processes payment → Status: for_release
   ↓
RELEASING WORKFLOW:
3. Releasing personnel sees item in "For Release" list
4. Releasing personnel marks as released → Status: completed
5. Activity logged for audit
```

## Clear Separation of Duties

| Role                    | Can Create Orders | Can Process Payments | Can Release Products | Access Level                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Cashier**             | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes               | Full (create, pay, release) |
| **Releasing Personnel** | ❌ No             | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes               | Read-only + Release         |

## Database Schema

No new migrations needed. Uses existing tables:

### `purchases` table

- `status` values: `pending` → `for_payment` → `for_release` → `completed`

### `transaction_histories` table

- `status` values: `pending` → `for_release` → `completed`

### `activity_logs` table

- Logs all release actions with type, user, and details

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Releasing personnel can access `/releasing` dashboard
- [x] Releasing personnel can view orders at `/releasing/orders`
- [x] Releasing personnel can view registrations at `/releasing/registrations`
- [x] Releasing personnel can mark orders as released
- [x] Releasing personnel can mark registrations as released
- [x] Releasing personnel CANNOT access `/cashier/pos`
- [x] Releasing personnel CANNOT access `/cashier/registrations`
- [x] Activity is logged when items are released
- [x] Routes are properly registered (verified via `route:list`)

## How to Test

### 1. Create a Releasing Personnel User

```php
User::create([
    'name' => 'Releasing Staff',
    'email' => 'releasing@example.com',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'utype' => 'releasing_personnel',
]);
```

### 2. Test the Workflow

1. **As Cashier**:
    - Login as cashier
    - Create an order in POS
    - Mark order as paid
    - Order status becomes `for_release`

2. **As Releasing Personnel**:
    - Login as releasing personnel
    - Navigate to Dashboard (`/releasing`)
    - Click "View Orders"
    - See the paid order in "For Release" tab
    - Click "Release" button
    - Order moves to "Completed" tab
    - Check activity logs

3. **Verify Restrictions**:
    - As releasing personnel, try to access `/cashier/pos`
    - Should be redirected back to releasing dashboard
    - Verify cannot create new orders

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Future improvements that could be added:

- [ ] Barcode scanning for faster release
- [ ] Signature capture for proof of delivery
- [ ] Photo upload of released products
- [ ] SMS notification when item is released
- [ ] Batch release (release multiple items at once)
- [ ] Print packing slips/delivery receipts
- [ ] Partial release capability (release some items, hold others)

## Summary

✅ **Complete separation of cashier and releasing roles**  
✅ **Read-only access for releasing personnel**  
✅ **Simple, clear interface for product distribution**  
✅ **Proper activity logging for audit trail**  
✅ **Security: Cannot access order creation or payment processing**

The releasing personnel workflow is now fully implemented and ready for use!
